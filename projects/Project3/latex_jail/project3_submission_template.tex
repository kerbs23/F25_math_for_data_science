I went through and went through and, after establishing a base case that is very similar to the default settints, changed a bunch of the settings one at a time, looking at their scores and how long they took to converge, as well as a large one based off a preliminary run.
I gave them all 10,000 iterations to try to converge to a tolerance of .001, and let it spin for a while.
