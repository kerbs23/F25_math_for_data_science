\section{\LaTeX}

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Experience.} I know a bit of the equation syntax, though not much of the document formatting stuff. As a computer nerd with oppinions, I am forced to mention Typst, which is built on being a good markup language, as opposed to \LaTeX, which seems to largely survive on path dependence and spite.

\section{GitHub}
\replace{My GitHub Project1 repository is located here:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/math-data-science-course/Project1}
\end{center}
}

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Experience.} Used Git for keeping track of some personal projects, but Im certainly no wizzard and no collaborative experience. Basic forking stuff on gh, but never studied it really.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Python and Google Colab}
I solved the folloing ProjectEuler problem: \url{https://projecteuler.net/problem=69}

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Solution.}
\noindent Used observations about how the score was connected to underlying prime factors to guess 510510, which a brute force run through showed to be correct.

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Experience.} Self-taught data science stuff by way of getting hired to do it before I was really qualified (Research econometrecs; so data cleaning, static analysis, fixed-effect regression and event study (staggered and no) causal type stuff), so my CS fundamentals arn't great but trying to improve.
A bit more reliant on AI than I am proud to admit, but also working on that.
